# 7digital Tech Principles

## Problem first, solution second

We focus on what is best for the customer, and deliver value early through a preference for simplicity. We innovate when a new approach is needed, and spend our time addressing unique business challenges.

## Autonomy yields progress

We believe autonomous teams make better decisions. All individuals are empowered to create positive change, across our work and culture.

## Collaborate for a better result

We are more than the sum of our parts when we work together. We highly value expertise while actively distributing knowledge. We communicate with transparency, and question to gain clarity. We want each other to succeed, and help each other.

## Accountability without blame

We foster an environment where it is safe to fail. We avoid blaming individuals or teams, but recognise a shared accountability. When the inevitable happens we invite criticism, listen, learn and improve.

## Aspire to quality

We build in quality from the beginning, and believe that working to a higher standard pays off in the long-term. We assess the consequences and have pragmatic conversations about risk. We write code with the next person in mind.

## Make informed decisions

Through understanding our customers and their users, and building observability into our systems we collect the data we need to inspire better decisions. We inform ourselves to deliver iteratively against our hypotheses.

## Invest in the long-term

We recognise the cost associated with our time, and invest it meaningfully. We remove repeated manual tasks, and automate the mundane. We think long-term with a “smart-lazy” mindset.

## Never stop learning

We believe in continuous improvement. We value fast and candid feedback, from our customers, stakeholders, and each other. We remain open-minded and flexible about what good looks like, and always endeavour to improve our products and processes.
